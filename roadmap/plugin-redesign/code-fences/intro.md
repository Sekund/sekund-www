# What is a code fence?

![code fence general](/img/code-fence-general.svg)

A code fence is a block in which the Markdown content will be interpreted according to the language invoked. In Obsidian you can use it to generate a block of code in html, js, php, etc.
These code fences are handy because their interpretation can be used for more than just formatting the content.
Sekund uses code fences to create its own functionality directly in the note. There are four at the moment: discussion, contact-index, group-index, status.
