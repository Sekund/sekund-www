# Contact-index

![code fence contact-index](/img/code-fence-contact-index.svg)

The "contact-index" code fence is created or updated when you click on one of your contacts.
In essence, the code fence will generate an index (i.e. a list) of the notes you share with your contact in a new note. This note is saved in the Sekund folder (in the tree on the left of Obsidian) which lists all the users you are in contact with.
