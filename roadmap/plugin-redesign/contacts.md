# Contacts

To share your note you need people to address it to.
The contact list shows you all the people or groups you are in contact with. Do you want to join a public group (open to all Sekund users), create a private or public group, find people you want to connect to? Below the list of contacts you have the possibility to do so.
Searching for a person requires that you know the e-mail address of the contact to be reached. This is to avoid disclosing all the identities of the people registered on Sekund. Once the profile is found via their email address, a notification is sent to them so that they accept your request to share.
The information relating to your profile is to be put in "profile". Each user will be able to consult it. Moreover, when you share your profile publicly on public.sekund.org, this information will be visible to anyone who sees your public note.
