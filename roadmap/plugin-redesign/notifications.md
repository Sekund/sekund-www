# Notifications

First, there are notifications from Sekund about possible problems with the plugin.
Then the notifications are sorted in anti-chronological order and concern 4 things: new shared notes, updated notes, new comments in a discussion, new views of your notes from other users.
Clicking on one of these notifications opens the note to which the notification relates.
