# Share

![Share schema](/img/share-schema.svg)

This feature allows you to share a note with people or groups in your contacts. There is also the possibility to create a public link. This link is for the note you are sharing out of context. You just get a URL for the note, which you can send according to your modalities. The URL is: public.sekund.org/er3sd2zeyq/your-note-name.
The "remove from Sekund server" button will remove the note from all sharing, either to your contacts or to the public link. Note that a note shared to other Sekund users will, technically, place your note in their device. Removing the note from the Sekund server will not remove the note from other users' Obsidian folders.
