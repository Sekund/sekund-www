# Discourse Graphs / Ibis

The discourse graph allows you to link several notes together in order to support a given issue or topic. This is very practical and even essential in a collaborative framework on a specific topic requiring the provision of assertions, evidence and sources.  
Each author participates in the elaboration of a coherent and synthetic whole in subjects related to scientific research for example.  
Implementing such a tool in Sekund would serve a particular type of collaboration requiring a series of linked arguments.  
What do we need? Ultimately a target note and a type of relationship our note has with it.

- **The topic or question**: the reference note on which other elements to produce or support a fact are based.
- **Assertion**: a note subordinate to the topic that will inform or generate arguments for the topic.
- **Evidence**: evidence is either subordinate to an assertion, in which case it validates or invalidates it (support/oppose). Evidence can also be directly subordinate to the subject, in which case it informs or generates arguments.
- **Sources**: are subordinate to evidence in order to support or contextualise. Sources include all the documentation that makes the evidence tangible.

Integrating this functionality for a discussion group seems to us to be welcome for certain knowledge production approaches and for research work. This need has not been formally requested by Sekund users and evaluating it would be a good thing. Also, please feel free to tell us about your practices or needs that such a feature could fill.
