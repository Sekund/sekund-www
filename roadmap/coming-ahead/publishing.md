# Publishing

Communities should be able to collaborate and publish their content without leaving their preferred tools.

There is a clear interest in allowing Sekund users to publish their notes on a website. From the perspective of collaborative work, we are evaluating and studying several possibilities that are available to us. Defining what the ideal publication environment would be means studying what is currently being done and for the moment we have drawn up a typology which can of course be improved and which deserves to be given feedback by users.

![Public link schema] (public-link-schema.svg)

**Public link**: a public link redirects to a web page accessible to all which contains the published (or publicly shared) note. This note is completely decontextualised and is not intended to fit into any particular structure. It is therefore an informal sharing.

![Public link schema] (blog-schema.svg)

**Blog**: A blog is a collection of notes (posts) which may or may not be related to each other except that they belong to an author and that this author wishes to give access to his published notes via a list of articles. For the moment this feature exists and is called "pubish".
The blog has an index page with the user's profile, the list of published notes and one page per published note.

![Group blog schema] (group-blog-schema.svg)

**Group blog**: The idea is the same as the blog, except that it contains all the notes published by a group. The context is already much more precise since the nature of a group is to work on a particular subject that needs to be specified and explained. The group blog therefore has a higher level of complexity than the blog. This option is to be considered and does not yet exist on Sekund.

![platform blog schema] (platform-blog-schema.svg)

**Blog platform**: the blog platform contains the notes published by all the users of a workspace. It is not a group blog but rather a network blog. There are therefore many notes and precise rules or algorithms must be able to determine the structure, importance and chronology of the articles. Display by theme, by category, by author, by date, etc.
Typically this is the case for Medium. The complexity is even higher than for the group blog, but there is a clear advantage in doing so to give more visibility or coherence to a set of notes. Imagine that associations working in different parts of the world on the theme of health need to share and publish their work. Each association could publish their studies or publications on their own website, but this would be quite tedious. Shouldn't there be (in addition) a site that includes all the work published by a whole community in order to have an overview of what is going on? The answer is yes. Having a workspace and an associated blog platform would definitely be an option.

![Editorial space schema] (editorial-space-schema.svg)

- **Editorial space**: The editorial space contains the same functionality as the blog platform except that it is dictated by an editorial policy. In the blog platform each post is published independently and there is ultimately no algorithm deciding what is priority/not priority, relevant/not relevant. The editorial space is more political in that there are certain rules to be respected and priorities to be given.

This is a brief overview of the typology of dissemination spaces envisaged by Sekund. Is it relevant? Does it meet concrete needs? Do we need to think differently?
We have this analysis of course within the framework of Obsidian's use and we hope one day to have enough input from users to refine this future project which seems to us really interesting.
