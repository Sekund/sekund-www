# Annotations

An annotation system should be provided so that different users with whom a note is shared can annotate directly in the document. There is a difference to be made between a discussion on the one hand and a co-authoring on the other.
A discussion, already implemented in a note, allows for an informal exchange on the content, for questioning it without seeing it as a revision or annotation process.
Co-writing allows several users to write in a note and finally to make it a participatory process. The latter does not make much sense in the case of an atomic note since the aim is for each participant to work independently. If the user wants to subordinate his or her note to that of another user, IBIS is designed for this purpose.
The annotations would allow to add content in a succinct way at the end of a paragraph to add information, a question and somehow participate in the revision of the document.
