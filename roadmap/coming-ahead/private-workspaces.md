# Private Workspaces

Private workspaces are the most requested feature.

For the moment there is only one workspace, the Sekund workspace. This workspace contains a database of all Sekund users. Eventually, we want to make it possible to create private workspaces. This means that an organisation could be completely independent in terms of its users and have its own database. Many people have made this request and we understand the interest in doing so. However, this adaptation technically requires a lot of time investment and also requires that an organisation making this request has people who can implement and update this workspace. The option is being considered but is not yet on the agenda.
