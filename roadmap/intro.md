# Roadmap intro

Sekund is based on Obsidian's philosophy of creating and organising a knowledge base through non-linear relationships between notes, independent of one's own working environment. The non-linear relationships between notes lead to the ability to atomise notes to make them more flexible and reusable.  
This atomised creation, this networked structure of content is finally a very good way to work within a group of people. Why be satisfied with your own knowledge production to advance your project and why not share your own research with others? Why not pool all our individual knowledge?

Share, discuss, disseminate. This is the promise that Sekund intends to develop since its creation. Sekund wants to support collective intelligence initiatives through these features that are ultimately simple to use.  
Isn't that what all social networks are about? Yes, in part. But the essence of Obsidian is to move from a promotional space to a collaborative space. Without this fundamental basis, Sekund would probably not be relevant.

Collaboration is essential for us. Digital transformation cannot do everything and its promise of socialisation has often, in the end, isolated people from each other, disconnected them from reality, polarised discussions, marginalised individuals, made them dependent on ephemeral visibility. Collaboration is not the promise of society but a precondition for making it possible. Sekund is only a tool and a space for exchange, so collaboration is up to you.

In this perspective, we don't want to carry this project without hearing what users have to tell us and teach us. Help us improve our product and share your experiences to inspire others.
